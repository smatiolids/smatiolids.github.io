# Samuel Matioli - Data & AI Architect

Hi, Iâ€™m **Samuel Matioli**, a tech professional with over 20 years of experience in **IT, AI, and software architecture**. I specialize in **Generative AI (GenAI)**, particularly **RAG pipelines**, **LLM agents**, and **Vector Search**. I currently work at **DataStax** as an **AI Architect and Developer Relations (DevRel)**, where I bridge the gap between cutting-edge GenAI technologies and real-world use cases.
